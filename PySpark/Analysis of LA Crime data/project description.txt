This project depicts the extensive analysis and research conducted on the data of the crimes that have been reported in the city of Los Angeles in the duration of the beginning of 2020 to present time (October of 2022). The research began by modifying the data appropriately to accommodate the analysis and Machine Learning algorithms, which are applied on the data to draw meaningful inferences from the data. Several patterns such as the weapon that has been used the most to commit the crimes, or the area in which the most crimes have been committed and even the current statuses of the complaints have been explored in this research. Machine Learning algorithms have been applied to the data to determine if a certain attribute of a crime can be estimated based on the other aspects of the crime.

The entire project has been executed in Jupyter Notebook, using PySpark technology. Additionally, MongoDb Comapss has been used for the ingestion of the data used for the analysis.
Within Jupyter Notebook, PySpark has been used for majority of the analysis and modeling of the data. Pandas and Matplotlib libraries have solely used for the purpose of simple visualizations, which were not supported by PySpark.
